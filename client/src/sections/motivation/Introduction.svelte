        The current paradigm of artificial intelligence, while powerful, is
        largely built on correlation. Models excel at learning statistical
        patterns from data but often fail when deployed in new environments
        where those patterns no longer hold. This brittleness stems from a lack
        of understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that generate the
        data. This thesis is motivated by the conviction that the next frontier
        for AI is the development of systems that can reason about cause and
        effect, enabling them to be more robust, explainable, and
        generalizable <Cite key="bookOfWhy"/>.
