        Predictive models often break when deployment conditions differ from the
        training distribution. This project studies Bayesian causal discovery as
        a way to make that fragility measurable and actionable by modeling
        uncertainty over causal graphs instead of returning a single best guess.
        The motivation is aligned with the argument that causal models are
        central for robust reasoning and intervention planning <Cite
