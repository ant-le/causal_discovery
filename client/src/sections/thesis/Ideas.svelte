            We could a meta-learning approach for generating a "warm
            start"-initialisation for the MCMC chains, making shorter chains
            more likely to converge

            Enable message parsing during MCMC (dependent chains) to potentially
            limit the search space for
            <strong>implausible edges</strong> or
            <strong>functional forms</strong> (e.g. with majority voting).

            Define causal structures as an abstraction layer (latent variables)
            and try to estimate theses from obserational data
