feat(refactor): address medium priority items and cleanup

- Consolidated graph metrics: moved `log_prob_graph_scores` to `metrics/graph.py` and removed `runners/graph_metrics.py`.
- Refactored `collate_fn_scm`: removed legacy tuple support, enforcing dictionary input.
- Documentation:
  - Renamed old README to `docs/PAPER_IDEAS.md`.
  - Created new `README.md` with installation and usage instructions.
  - Added `docs/PROFILING.md` checklist.
- Logging: Added lightweight environment report on run start.
- Fixed `GradScaler` to use the modern `torch.amp` API.
- Updated `TODO.md` to reflect completed tasks and verified with `pytest`.
